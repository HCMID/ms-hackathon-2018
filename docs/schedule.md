Preliminary outline.


9:00-9:45:  **Register, meet your project leader, pre-flight checkup** (registration desk at entrance to Hogan 3, with directions to assigned work location for each team).  Each team should have at least one [fully configured computer](../tech), and at least one additional computer with a web browser.  Coffee available for those who need it.

9:45-10:15:  **Overview of the hackathon** (all in Hogan Ballroom).  Review the day's schedule; introduction to citing images, and creating a table of paleogaphic observations.

10:15-10:45:  **break out session**:  each team records paleographic observations.

10:45-11:15:  **Introduction to editing**. Indexing text to images, and introduction to XML.

11:15-12:15:  **break out session**:  begin editing your text.

12:00-12:45:  lunch (location?  in workspaces on Hogan 3?)

12:45-1:30:    **Share work so far**.  Questions, problems, success stories?  Anything we should be on the look out for in the afternoon?

1:30-2:30:   **break out session**:  edit and validate your text.  Your project leader can run scripts that analyze your editing, and check your work for inconsistencies and errors.

2:30-2:45:  snack break

2:45-3:45:  **two options**:

1.  *continue editing and validating* your assigned text or additional texts.  We hope every team will be able to submit a complete, validated XML edition of their text by 3:45!
2.  *introduction to version control*.  If you team has already completed its first editing assignment, you can learn how you can use the `git` version control system to continue collaborating with us after the hackathon.

3:45-4:15:  **compile our complete edition**!  Project leaders will compile all contributions into a single edition.

4:15-4:30:  **Wrap up** (Hogan Ballroom).
