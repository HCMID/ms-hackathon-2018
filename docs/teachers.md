As far as possible, we'll try to form small teams that allow teachers to work with groups of their own students.  We want to make sure that early Latin students have a teacher on their team at all times.  More advanced students might be placed in teams on their own, but we'll give you opportunities to jump in with all your students if you bring a large enough group to form more than one team.

During the day, we'll have information about one-day workshops we're planning for next year (2018-2019) that can earn you PDPs.  These workshops include more formal training in working with manuscripts, and pedagogical applications using manuscripts in Latin classrooms from first-year to AP Latin.
