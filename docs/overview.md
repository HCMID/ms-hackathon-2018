On February 24,


work is in teams

Before the day is over, we will complete a digital diplomatic edition of the Bern Physiologus, keyed to freely available digital images of the text.

We will test our digital edition with scripts that parse the Latin text and analyze the format of the edition.  Once all automated tests are passed, we will publish the edition in the Holy Cross Institutional Repository, where it.  All hackathon participants will be named as contributors
