**Hannah Nguyen** '19 made this hackathon happen:  she managed all the invisible logistical work.  (If you're not from Holy Cross, you probably can't imagine what a feat it is to reserve the main floor of Hogan Center for an entire Saturday.)

We'd like to thank **Hanna Seariac** for helping inspire this project and for contributing to its planning.

The event was made possible by the support of the Holy Cross  [Ignite Fund](https://www.holycross.edu/center-liberal-arts-world/create-your-own-project).  Thanks to the **Center for Liberal Arts in the World** and its director, **Professor Daniel Klinghard**, for enabling students to share their skills and passions with the world beyond Holy Cross.
