## Preparing for the hackathon

The only software you need is:

-  a web browser
-  the free Atom text editor for our work.  Please [download and install it](https://atom.io/) before coming to the hackathon.


## After the hackathon

We'll add links here to further technical information for teams who want to continue collaborating with us after the hackathon.
