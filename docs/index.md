## What is a manuscripts hackathon?

-   A free, one-day workshop for secondary-school teachers and students.  We'll work together to create a digital edition of a cool 9th-century Latin  manuscript with illustrated allegorical stories about animals (lions, mandrakes, snakes, pelicans and more).
-  No prior experience with manuscripts or editing required. Students should currently be taking a Latin class (any level).
-  We'll provide lunch and snacks, and: you bring a laptop.


## Who's doing this?

The hackathon is organized by undergraduate students and alumni of the Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club at the College of the Holy Cross.
