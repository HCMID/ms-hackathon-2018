## What is a manuscripts hackathon?

-   A free, one-day workshop for secondary-school teachers and students.
-   You'll learn how to read and edit Latin manuscripts.
-   No prior experience with manuscripts or editing is required. Students should currently be taking a Latin class (any level).
-   We'll create a digital edition of a cool [9th-century Latin  manuscript with illustrated allegorical stories about animals](thumbs) (lions, mandrakes, snakes, pelicans and more).
-   We'll provide lunch, snacks and training: you bring a laptop and enthusiasm.
-   You will be cited as a contributing editor in a publication of the manuscript in the Holy Cross Library's digital Institutional Repository, [CrossWorks](http://crossworks.holycross.edu/).


## Who's doing this?

The hackathon is organized by undergraduate students and alumni of the [Manuscripts, Inscriptions and Documents Club](http://hcmid.github.io/) (HCMID) at the [College of the Holy Cross](https://www.holycross.edu/).
