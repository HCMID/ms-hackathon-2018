As part of the hackathon, you'll learn how to cite texts, pages of the manuscript and images using URN notation.

We'll use the following URNs in our collaborative editions:


-   Collection of images: `urn:cite2:ecod:bern318imgs.v1:`
-   Pages of the manuscript: `urn:cite2:mid:bern318pages.v1:`
-   The text of the Physiologus:  `urn:cts:mid:bestiaries.bern318.hc:`


## Using the `bash` shell in your terminal

Commands you'll need:

-  `cd`  ("**C**hange **D**irectory"): change your shell to a new folder
-   `pwd`   ("**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectorty"): show what folder your terminal is currently in


## Running test scripts

Make sure your terminal is in the right folder (use `pwd`)

Start the testing environment:  `sbt console`
