As part of the hackathon, you'll learn how to cite texts, pages of the manuscript and images using URN notation.

We'll use the following URNs in our collaborative editions:


-   Collection of images: `urn:cite2:ecod:bern318imgs.v1:`
-   Pages of the manuscript: `urn:cite2:mid:bern318pages.v1:`
-   The text of the Physiologus:  `urn:cts:mid:bestiaries.bern318.hc:`
